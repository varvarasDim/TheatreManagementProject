# TheatreManagementProject
A simple Theatre Management java application
This is a simple Theatre Management application. It is a code that I wrote at during my first year at the University.

It has a simple menu and you can insert/delete/edit at most 10 plays. For each play you can make reservations. 
The positions of the seats which are presented, are read from the txt file seatsFile. There are three seat categories. 
Balcony Seats, A Square Seats and B Square Seats.
